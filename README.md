# hello-world
my first repository 
well, first of all, i love math; and then i took the medicine in college following my parents and teacher's advice; but now i still love math and i am ready to plunge into the big data science industry. hopefully, i will begin a new career that i like. honestly, being a doctor is not what i really like. i like doing math....And that's all about me for now. Hope to become a real data scientist soon!
